NUI Devtools is a development tool that facilitates the creation of scripts in HTML and JS. Unfortunately, many people use it for inappropriate purposes.
This script will allow you to successfully block people who have the dev tools console. Regardless of whether in a browser at http://localhost:13172/ or in the FiveM window

1. You can edit the script at will on your server.
2. Leave a mention of the authors, eg in a webhook or in a comment in the script.
